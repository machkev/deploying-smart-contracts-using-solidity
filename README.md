# Deploying Smart Contracts Using Solidity

Three smart contracts have been posted on the Kovan network. The contracts will help to automate some company finances inlcuding increase transparency and to make accounting and auditing practically automatic. Specifically, the contracts will:
*  Pay the Associate-level employees quickly and easily
*  Distribute profits to different tiers of employees
*  Distribute company shares for employees in a deffered equity incentive plan automatically.
